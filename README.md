System-GMM-Model

Econometric analysis carried out for my master's degree dissertation. Developed a System GMM dynamic panel data model in Stata to identify the factors which influence export performance at the firm level. The analysis was carried out using firm-level microdata from a population of 2,780 companies which are clients of Enterprise Ireland.

Stata do files for specifying and running the model are included as well as the dissertation paper itself.
